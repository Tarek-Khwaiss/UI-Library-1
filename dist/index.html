        <p>VanillaJS is a name to refer to using JS without any additional libraries like
            <span data-message="The most used js library" class="tooltip"><a href="https://jquery.com"
                    target="_blank">jQuerys</a></span> back in
            the days. People use it as a joke to remind other developers that many things can be done nowadays without
            the need for additional JavaScript libraries.

            <div class="content">
                The history of the Vanilla JS site, which poses as a "JS framework" site, is short but funny. Eric Wastl
                created it in 2012, using a bit of trolling and confusion to hammer home a point: you can often use
                plain
                JavaScript instead of additional JS frameworks or libraries.
                While Eric didn't coin the term per se, his site definitely helped popularize it.

                <div class="content">
                    Historically speaking, developers needed to bypass plain JavaScript for MANY tasks, be it to make
                    their
                    code behave consistently across browsers or just to go beyond what Javascript offered at the time.
                    We're
                    talking IE 6-7 days. Developers often defaulted to jQuery in the process. But this long-lasting
                    reflex
                    of relying on external libraries is now irrelevant, thanks to the evolution of the ECMAScript spec
                    and
                    modern browsers keeping up with it more closely.

                <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now
                    maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and corporations. React allows
                    developers to build complex user interfaces with a modular approach, using reusable components. It
                    is
                    known for its speed and efficient update mechanism, making it ideal for building high-performance
                    and
                    dynamic applications.</p>

                <h3>Angular</h3>
                <p>Angular is a comprehensive JavaScript framework for building single-page applications (SPAs).
                    Developed
                    and maintained by Google, Angular provides a platform for building complex and scalable applications
                    using a modular architecture. It features a rich set of built-in services, directives, and tools,
                    making
                    it easy for developers to build and test applications. Angular uses two-way data binding and a
                    component-based architecture, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components and efficient
                    management of application state.</p>

                <h3>VueJs</h3>
                <p>Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It was created by Evan You and is now
                    maintained by a large open-source community. Vue is known for its simplicity, lightweight size, and
                    flexibility. It uses a component-based architecture and a template-based syntax, making it easy for
                    developers to create reusable UI components. Vue also offers a reactive data model, making it
                    efficient
                    for updating and rendering changes in real-time. The framework has a growing popularity and is often
                    used for building high-performance and user-friendly single-page applications (SPAs).</p>
